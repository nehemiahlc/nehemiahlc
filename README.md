👋🏾 Hey, I’m @code-nemo — just a self-taught dev chasing the work from anywhere dream.

⚛️ I'm currently focused on learning JavaScript, React, React Native, and Next.js by building cool projects.

🎥 I create cinematic + funny YouTube videos and social media content to document my journey and inspire others.

🌱 Open-source contributions, freelance work, and launching my own apps? That’s the roadmap. I’m building it in public, and you’re invited.
