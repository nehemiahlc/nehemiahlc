-👋🏾 Hi, I’m @code nemo, a self-taught **software engineer** passionate about backend development, algorithms, and problem-solving.

🔧 I have hands-on experience with **Siwft** and **Python**, and I'm currently learning **Java**, and **Spring Boot**, while also expanding my knowledge of data structures, algorithms, and cloud technologies

💻 I love solving LeetCode-style problems to enhance my algorithmic thinking and technical skills.

🌱 I’m eager to contribute to open-source projects to gain experience and give back to the community, while also building a foundation for future bounty sourcing, SaaS, or freelance opportunities.

🗒️ Check out my repositories to see what I’ve been working on!
